# Welcome to Bank API!

This weekend exercise is aims to practice basic CRUD operation with Mongoose as database, handling both client and servers sides.
In addition, this exercise aims to practice deploying both server and client sides to Heroku, in one repo.
Please note: this weekend exercise was done in a time frame of, well, a weekend. therefor styling the UI and other non-core features was cut out if this project.

# Welcome to Bank API!

This weekend exercise is aimed to practice basic CRUD operation with Mongoose as a database, handling both client and servers sides.
In addition, this exercise aims to practice deploying both server and client sides to Heroku, in one repo.
Please note: this weekend exercise was done in a time frame of, well, a weekend. Therefore things like styling the UI, and giving the user action feedback, and other non-core features were cut out of this project, as they were not the focus of this assignment.
